# EN2130 Communication Design Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the files and code for the **EN2130 Communication Design Project**, focused on building a point-to-point digital wireless communication system using software-defined radios (SDRs).

### Key Features

- **Transmission of Images, Voice, and Video** over a wireless channel.
- Communication in the **2.4 GHz ISM band**, adhering to power limitations.
- Performance evaluation based on:
  - Distance
  - End-to-end delay

### Optional Features (to be implemented)

- **Security** features for secure communication.
- **Channel estimation** to improve transmission quality.
- **Adaptive transmission** to optimize performance under varying conditions.

## Project Structure

- `/src` - Contains source code for the system.
- `/docs` - Documentation related to system design and implementation.
- `/tests` - Test scripts for evaluating system performance.
- `/media` - Example image, voice, and video files for transmission.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NaveenSanjaya/DigitalCommDesign.git
